# 🌀 Block-Snooze: Own Your Focus, One Tab at a Time

**Block-Snooze** is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to help you reclaim your attention. Automatically hide or close distracting tabs on a precise schedule—down to the hour and minute—and domain-wide snoozing ensures a single action keeps all related tabs out of your way. When your timer expires, tabs reopen or close automatically, so you stay on track without lifting a finger.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **⌛ Flexible Scheduling**  
  Set timers in hours & minutes (up to days) for both snoozing and closing tabs—perfect for any workflow.

- **🔒 Domain-Wide Blocking**  
  Snooze one instance of a site (e.g., YouTube) and **every** tab from that domain is hidden or closed.

- **📊 Central Dashboard**  
  Your one-stop view of all active snoozes and scheduled closures, complete with live countdowns and remove/unsnooze controls.

- **🔔 Notifications**  
  Receive clear alerts moments before any tab hides, reopens, or closes—so you’re never caught off guard.

- **🔧 One-Click UI**  
  Manage and configure all your timers from a simple, distraction-free toolbar popup.

- **🛡️ Privacy-First**  
  All functionality runs locally in your browser; no data is ever sent to external servers.

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Batch your workflows:** Group related tabs (e.g., research) and snooze them together for focused blocks.
- **Use domain snooze:** One snooze blocks all tabs on that domain—ideal for social media or news sites.
- **Check your Dashboard regularly:** Stay ahead of reopening tabs so you’re never surprised.
- **Cancel unneeded timers:** Keep your environment clean by removing old snoozes.
